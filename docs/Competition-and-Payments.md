### Payments (Razorpay)

#### Frontend sequence
1. Create order via backend
   - POST `/api/payment/create-order` body: `{ amount, currency: 'INR', receipt, notes? }`
   - Response: `{ orderId, amount, currency, receipt }`
2. Load Razorpay SDK: `paymentService.loadRazorpaySDK()`
3. Open checkout with `paymentService.initializeRazorpayPayment(orderId, amount, 'INR', name, description, prefill, notes)`
4. On success handler, receive `{ razorpay_order_id, razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_signature }`
5. Verify on backend: POST `/api/payment/verify` with the above
6. For competition, POST `/api/payment/competition` with `{ name, mobile, competitionId, amount, paymentId }` if required by flow

#### Payment status
- GET `/api/payment/status/:paymentId` returns payment status for display/troubleshooting

#### Security notes
- Only the backend holds `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`
- Frontend uses `REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` when opening checkout
